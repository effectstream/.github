# Effectstream

Effectstream is a Web3 Engine optimized for building dApps and on-chain infrastructure.

* Connect multiple chains, leveraging their tech as tokens, and existing markets.
* Build on-chain dApps without blockchain specific knowledge.
* Secure: all interactions go into the chains and not your Effectstream Node.
* Iterate quickly as tools are developer centered.
